Reference: ALHGGWTTK
Homo sapiens hits (after removing X): 110
Identical to reference (ignored for specificity): 1

Discriminative positions (P = 1-based positions):
  Conservative: [1, 8, 3, 7, 2]  (uncovered hits: 0)
    Residues to define: P1:A, P8:T, P3:H, P7:T, P2:L  (motif: ATHTL)
  Practical:    [1, 8, 3, 7, 2]  (uncovered hits: 0)
    Residues to define: P1:A, P8:T, P3:H, P7:T, P2:L  (motif: ATHTL)

Minimal contiguous unique window vs hits:
  Conservative: none
  Practical:    P2..P7 sequence LHGGWT

Recommended specificity using minimal window (practical):
  Positions: P2..P7  sequence LHGGWT
  X-pattern: XLHGGWTXX

Recommended specificity using greedy set (conservative):
  Positions: [1, 8, 3, 7, 2]
  Residues to define: P1:A, P8:T, P3:H, P7:T, P2:L
  X-pattern: ALHXXXTTX

Notes:
- Conservative treats unknown residues ('?') as potentially matching, leading to stricter (sometimes impossible) uniqueness criteria.
- Practical treats unknown residues as mismatches, providing actionable targets with available information.
